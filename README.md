# UQC-TOOLS
A Hybrid of PS script and python for Scanners aka ( manhwa, manga, webtoon scanners )

# Everything you need in one place for QC's and Uploaders.

Add Raws:
Add raw files as new layers below existing content in the currently active document.

Add CLRD:
Add CLRD files as new layers above existing content in the currently active document.

Note: Add CLRD/RAW - Raw: when you forget you've CLRD'd without having a copy of raw.
CLRD: when you've the raw but want to add CLRD.

Both supports batch add - it automatically sorts by name/num and places them in perfectly, so you don't need to wonder if it was placed or order is not correct ( of course if for some dumb reason your not EDing Pg 5, 7, 10 lol )

Merge to PNG:
Merge multiple open documents or selected files into a single vertical PNG file.

Split PNG:
Split a large PNG image into multiple smaller JPEG files based on a height.

Note2: yep now you don't need to search for stitchers or spliter this script exactly does that inside Photoshop! So you don't need any sus program. It does everything automatically you don't need to do anything ( well except choosing your save location )

Merge is merge lol, split is set to default 6000 but not fret you can set your own just run the script and you know where. The naming scheme for split is 001,002,003 and so on.

Convert Webtoon Standard Size:
Resize the active document to a webtoon standard size, with a fixed width of 800 pixels while maintaining the aspect ratio.
