# UQC-TOOLS  
A Magical Fusion of Photoshop Scripts and Python for the Unsung Heroes: Scanners (Yes, You, the Manhwa, Manga, and Webtoon Scanners)

## **All Your QC and Uploader Needs Wrapped in One Neat Package**

### **Add Raws/CLRD:**

Because who doesn’t love a good layer cake?

- **Add Raws**: Drop your raw files like a pro, layering them smoothly below your current content. 
- **Add CLRDs**: For those moments when you realize, "Oh snap, I have the raw, but I need to add the CLRD on top."

> **Pro Tip**:  
> - **Raw**: When you’ve mysteriously CLRD’d something without keeping a raw backup.  
> - **CLRD**: When you've got the raw but need that sweet, sweet CLRD layer on top.

Both methods support batch additions, automatically sorting by name/number. So, no more pondering if you’ve gone off the rails by skipping Pg 5, 7, or 10 (because who even needs to edit in numerical order, right?).

### **SMART STITCHING:**

Need to combine a bunch of images into one, towering monolith? Done.  
Now with automatic width detection and pixel-perfect precision, it stitches your images so seamlessly you’ll swear it had human intelligence (it doesn’t, but it’s smart enough). So, stop worrying—your images will merge in order and *perfectly*.

### **SMART SPLITTING:**

**The “Algorithmic” Feature You Didn’t Know You Needed!**

Got a tall PNG that needs slicing? This bad boy uses Python to split your image without decapitating speech bubbles, SFX, or other critical content. It's an "ALGORITHM," folks.  
You can even tweak the sensitivity and scan steps for an even better split. _Default is set to 100, 60—because that’s the sweet spot._
