# UQC-TOOLS
A Hybrid of PS script and python for Scanners aka ( manhwa, manga, webtoon scanners )

## Everything you need in one place for QC's and Uploaders.

### **Add Raws/CLRD:**

Add raw files as new layers below existing content in the currently active document.

Add CLRD files as new layers above existing content in the currently active document.

>Note: Add CLRD/RAW - 

Raw: when you forget you've CLRD'd without having a copy of raw.

CLRD: when you've the raw but want to add CLRD. 

Efficient Image management seamlessly integrate Raw and CLRD layers into existing files.

Both supports batch add - it automatically sorts by name/num and places them in perfectly, so you don't need to wonder if it was placed or order is not correct ( of course if for some dumb reason your not EDing Pg 5, 7, 10 lol )

### **SMART STITCHING:**

Quickly combine multiple image files into a single vertical layout. 
Now it detects the width of and uses PS to match the width of all stitched images.
It has all the logics and etc so dont worry it merges them in order and perfectly!

### **SMART SPLITTING:**

**The long awaited "Algorithmic" feature!**

Automatically splits your tall ass PNGs/Opened documents to your desired height and it uses PYTHON to split without splitting speech bubbles,SFX, other contents! It uses "ALGORITHM"
Not only that but you can set custom sensitivity and scan steps for better Splitting!
_default is set to 60 I find that pretty accurate._


### **Convert Webtoon Standard Size:**

One-click resizing to 800px width with logic to dynamically set the height based on width.
